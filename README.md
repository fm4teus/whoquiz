## 📑 About

Developed during the 2nd edition of [Alura](https://alura.com.br)'s Imersão React and deployed with [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), this quiz tests your knowledge about Doctor Who and it is available at [WhoQUIZ](https://whoquiz.vercel.app/).


## 📚 Functionality

WhoQuiz is a web quiz application. The user can test his knowledge by trying to answer some questions about Doctor Who. These questions are randomly selected from a JSON file that acts like our database. By the end of the test, the user receives his results.

A user can also open another Quiz in the same app. This functionality reads the questions from other JSON using fetch-API. WhoQuiz also exports the db.json so other apps can read and display our questions. 

## 🛠 Updates

Imersão React was an amazing opportunity to improve my knowledge of some powerful technologies. Nevertheless, there is still a lot of room for improvement. In this section, I'll keep you updated as new features are introduced.

- Questions are now randomly selected from the database. Now the game still interesting even after you've played a couple of times.
- (✔Solved) There was a bug that prevented the user from select the same alternative from the last question.
